# Customer-Segmentation-with-RFM-Analysis


## Business Problem

FLO wants to segment its customers and determine marketing strategies according to these segments. To this end, the behaviors of the customers will be defined and groups will be formed according to the clustering in these behaviors.

The project was created by performing the following tasks.
- Understanding and Preparing Data
- Calculation of RFM Metrics
- Calculation of RF Score
- Definition of RF Score as Segments

The data used in the studies belong to FLO, one of the largest e-commerce companies in Turkey, and these data cannot be shared due to commercial confidentiality.
